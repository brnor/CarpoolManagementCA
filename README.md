# CarpoolManagementCA

## Requires:
  - .NET Core 3.1
  - npm
  
## Setup
The project can be published using `dotnet` while targeting the WebUI project. (Works using only binaries, too).

```
dotnet publish -c Release ./CarpoolManagementCA/src/WebUI/
```

This will build the .NET project and run `npm` to install dependencies needed for the frontend. It will also make a static build of the frontend.
By default, the project should be published to a path similar to this one:
`./CarpoolManagementCA/src/bin/Release/netcoreapp3.1/publish`

From here, you can again use `dotnet` to run the .NET project:
```
dotnet run ./CarpoolManagementCA/src/WebUI/bin/Release/netcoreapp3.1/publish/WebUI.dll
```
By default the project should be hosted on `https://localhost:5001` and `http://localhost:5000`.

The frontend can be served by any simple http server. Upon completing the project build, you are given an example of using a tool `serve` which is installed via `npm`.
```
npm install -g serve
serve -s -l 3000 ./CarpoolManagementCA/src/WebUI/bin/Release/netcoreapp3.1/publish/ClientApp/build
```

Please note that HTTPS redirection is disabled and the project currently uses HTTP to communicate.
